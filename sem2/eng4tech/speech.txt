Alright. Good day! Thank you for coming. I'm gonna give a talk about the role
of English language worldwide with an emphasis on why English is also or maybe
even especially important for so called techmakers. Don't you know who are 
techmakers? Techmakers are all kinds of engineers, scientists, technical guys
who just make things around us work. They are like most of you in this
audience, technical university students, researchers and teaching staff. 

Well, you might have already read my name (I am first year masters' student),
the title and mentioned these two nice guys with guns. Don't you know who
are they? - No, they are not techmakers, they are characters of action
movie Pulp Fiction. You know, the title of my talk is a remade quotation
from this movie. If you haven't watched it yet, go and watch it today.
Better watch it in English.

Yes, English, techmakers, do you speak it?

Okay, so what's the plan?

Here you can see a short plan briefly describing the reasonal points why you'd
better speak English.

It's not only bare business for me to make you think so, but
I have a personal reason to think so myself and persuade you to think so.

The history also matters. As it was said by Martin Luther King Jr.: <<We are
not makers of history. We are made by history.>> Right you are, Martin.  We'll
remember that. So but we are really not history makers - we are techmakers,
right?

That's is why next we're gonna discuss why we ourselves need English to help us
carry out our research and development.

And in conlusion I will try to give you even more motivation and provide some
tips for learning English.

Me, I've tried my best at one major and still try my best at another major.
	
I got my bachelors degree in Instrumentation at the faculty of Automation
and Computer Engineering, dealing a lot with hardware development and design.

Now I am going to my masters' degree at the faculty Applied Math and Computer
Science dealing more with data and algorithms.

I'm telling this not to show off, to say that I'm kind a super genius guy. No!

The point is that it does not matter what you are dealing with: hardware,
software, algorithms. Doesn't matter. The matter is that you will nevertheless
need English and take much benefit of knowledge of it.

And I can't remember a discipline at which I didn't get benefit from my
knowledge of English.

That is my personal experience, personal reason of thinking that English is a
must.
