Alright. Good day! Thank you for coming. I'm gonna give a talk about the role
of English language worldwide with an emphasis on why English is also or maybe
even especially important for so called techmakers. I wonder if you know who
techmakers are? (pause) - Techmakers are all kinds of engineers, scientists,
technical guys who just make things around us work. They are like
most of you in this audience, technical university students,
researchers, engineers, teaching staff. 

My name is ... . I am a first year master of science program student. You see
the title and mentioned these two nice guys with guns. Do you know who these
guys are? - Obviously, they are not techmakers, they are characters of action
Quentin Tarantino's movie Pulp Fiction. You know, the title of my talk is a
remade quotation from this movie. If you haven't watched it yet, go and watch
it today.  I want you to watch it in English and today. (TODO: Make it clear!
Tarantino.)

English, right, English, techmakers, do you speak it?

Okay, so what's the plan?

Here you can see a short plan briefly describing the reasonal points why you'd
better speak English.

It's not only bare business for me to make you think so, but
I have a personal reason to think so by myself and persuade you to think so.

The history also matters. Here I'll mention a historical reason why English is
so wide spread.

Next point we're gonna discuss is why we need English to help us
carry out our research and development.

And in conlusion I will try to give you even more motivation and provide some
tips for learning English.

You know

I got my bachelors degree in Instrumentation at the faculty of Automation
and Computer Engineering, dealing a lot with hardware development and design.

Now I am working on my masters' degree at the faculty Applied Math and Computer
Science dealing more with data and algorithms.

I'm telling you this not to show off, to say that I'm kind a super genius guy.
No!

The point is that it does not matter what you are dealing with: hardware,
software, algorithms. Doesn't matter. The matter is that you will nevertheless
need English and take much benefit from it if you learn it.

And I can't remember a discipline that I didn't get benefit using my
knowledge of English.

That's my personal experience, personal reason of thinking that English is a
must.

Going to some historical reason going back to the times of British Empire
taking large world territory we've got what we've got. The situation is the
following.
---
There are 1.5 billion people around the world speaking English. You can check
it. approx. 4 billion as second language

As you know English is the language of world diplomacy, sport, science,
technology, education, the Internet, mass media and tourism and so forth.
Certainly we are mostly interested in science, technology and education.

The most terrific point for me and I'm sure that it's also so for most of you,
English is the language of software development. Have you ever seen a
programming language used in production which keywords was from Japanese,
Chinese, German? - I have not.

I've decided to draw your attention to the site ... because ...

Speaking and understanding English speech and text is about general literacy
and awareness.  Generally speaking, the more languages you know, the more aware
and literal you are, the more points of view and opinions you can evaluate.

We live in the Age of Infomation. They say that the one who owns information,
that one rules the world. With development of the Internet the more
information became accessible. But not all information is useful. Actually,
that one who can extract knowledge from information that one rules the
world. To extract knowledge one needs deep understanding of data.
Assuming you are dealing with information in English - the better you know
English, the more useful information you can extract.

In my conclusion I want to offer you some tips on improving your English.
Some of them might look for you obvious, though. Watch movies, listen to music,
read, speak and surf the web in English.

Learn English, and these guys will not come for you.
